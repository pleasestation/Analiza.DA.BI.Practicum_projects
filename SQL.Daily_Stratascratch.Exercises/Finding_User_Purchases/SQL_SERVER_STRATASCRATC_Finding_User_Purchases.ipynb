    "- **Purpose**: Lists each user's transactions with a sequential number (`transaction_num`), ordered by the `created_at` date.\r\n",
    "- **`ROW_NUMBER()`**: Assigns a unique, sequential integer to each transaction per user, starting at 1 for the earliest transaction and increasing for later transactions.\r\n",
    "- **`PARTITION BY user_id`**: Restarts row numbering for each `user_id`.\r\n",
    "- **`ORDER BY created_at`**: Orders transactions by date.\r\n",

    "#### Main Query: Identify Returning Active Users\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves `user_id` of users who made a second purchase within 7 days of any other purchase.\r\n",
    "- **`JOIN` Operation**: Performs a self-join on `UserTransactions` (`t1` and `t2`) to compare each user's transactions.\r\n",
    "  - **`t1.user_id = t2.user_id`**: Ensures comparisons are made within the same user.\r\n",
    "  - **`t1.transaction_num < t2.transaction_num`**: Compares an earlier transaction (`t1`) with a later one (`t2`).\r\n",
    "  - **`DATEDIFF(day, t1.created_at, t2.created_at) <= 7`**: Checks if the difference between the two transaction dates is 7 days or less.\r\n",
    "- **`SELECT DISTINCT`**: Ensures each `user_id` appears only once in the output.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Output\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The query returns a list of `user_id`s for users who have made at least two purchases within a 7-day period, identifying \"returning active users.\"\r\n"
