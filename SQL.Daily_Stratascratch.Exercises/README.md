# Daily StrataScratch Exercises - Analisa Data Analyst Course

## Overview

This repository contains a series of daily exercises completed on StrataScratch as part of the Analisa Data Analyst course. These exercises are designed to enhance practical skills in data querying, manipulation, and analysis using SQL and Python.

## Objectives

- Strengthen SQL querying and data manipulation techniques.
- Develop proficiency in Python, focusing on data analysis using Pandas and NumPy.
- Apply analytical skills to solve real-world data challenges.

## SQL Theory

Understanding SQL is fundamental for working with relational databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with databases, allowing you to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data. Key concepts covered in these exercises include:

- **Data Retrieval**: Using `SELECT` statements to query specific data from one or more tables.
- **Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables based on a related column using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
- **Aggregations**: Summarizing data with functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.
- **Subqueries**: Writing queries within queries to perform complex data retrieval tasks.
- **Data Manipulation**: Inserting, updating, and deleting data using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
- **Database Management**: Creating and managing database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.

## Exercises Summary

- **SQL Exercises**: Focus on various aspects of SQL, including complex queries, data aggregation, joins, subqueries, and database management.
